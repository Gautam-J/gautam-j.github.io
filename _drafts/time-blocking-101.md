### Introduction

Time management is something that people struggle with throughout their life.
In this blog, I intend to share the reasons why we struggle with managing our time,
as well as introduce a technique called _time blocking_, which is used by many people who
are highly productive. Finally, I also share some practical examples of how I use
time blocking, and how you can use it for your own schedule as well.

### Why we struggle with Time Management?

Let's say we have 2 tasks to complete. _Task1_ is an **urgent** one, and upon completion
of it we get a **reward immediately**. _Task2_ is not urgent, but it is **important** that
you finish it. However, upon completion of it, you get the reward only after a **long period** of time.

**NOTE**: I have not given practical examples for _Task1_ and _Task2_, since the very notion
of a particular task being urgent and/or important varies for different people.
Feel free to assume your own Task1 and Task2.

When asked to choose a task between _Task1_ and _Task2_ to complete, most people choose _Task1_, i.e., the one
which is _urgent_ and gives you a _reward immediately_. The fact that the task is
urgent gives a false sense of information that it must be done as soon as possible
**even if it is not important**. We are more likely to prioritize the urgent tasks over the
important ones, regardless of the much better payoffs of the important tasks in the long run.
This is known as the **mere-urgency effect**.

This indicates the first problem that causes bad time management: **bad prioritization of tasks**.

### How to better prioritize tasks?

When we get a new task to complete, we fix in our mind that we have this so-and-so
task that is to be completed within a particular deadline. After this, two things might happen
-- either we get another task, and we totally **forget about the previous task**, or we keep thinking
about this task and **cannot focus on any other task** that we have to do.
Either way, the outcome does not go in favor for us. These unfinished tasks that
lure inside our mind are called **open loops**.

In order to better prioritize your tasks, you first need a safe place to store all your
tasks. And NO, your brain is NOT that place.

Solution to bad prioritization of tasks: **use a to-do list**.

### What is Time Blocking?

One of the early adopters of this technique is _Benjamin Franklin_.
