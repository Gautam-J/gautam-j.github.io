### Introduction

Time management is something that people struggle with throughout their life.
In this blog, I intend to share the reasons why we struggle with managing our time,
as well as introduce a technique called _time blocking_, which is used by many people who
are highly productive. One of the early adopters of this
technique is _Benjamin Franklin_. Finally, I also share some practical examples of how I use
time blocking, and how you can use it for your own schedule as well.

### Why we struggle with Time Management?

Let's say we have 2 tasks to complete. _Task1_ is an **urgent** one, and upon completion
of it we get a **reward immediately**. _Task2_ is not urgent, but it is **important** that
you finish it. However, upon completion of it, you get the **reward only after a long period** of time.

**NOTE**: I have not given practical examples for _Task1_ and _Task2_, since the very notion
of a particular task being urgent and/or important varies for different people.
Feel free to assume your own Task1 and Task2.

When asked to choose a task between _Task1_ and _Task2_ to complete, most people choose _Task1_, i.e., the one
which is _urgent_ and gives you a _reward immediately_. The fact that the task is
urgent gives a false sense of information that it must be done as soon as possible
even if it is not important. We are more likely to prioritize the urgent tasks over the
important ones, regardless of the much better payoffs of the important tasks in the long run.
This is known as the **mere-urgency effect**.

This indicates the first problem that causes bad time management: **bad prioritization of tasks**.

When we get a new task to complete, we fix in our mind that we have this so-and-so
task that is to be completed within a particular deadline. After this, two things might happen
-- either we get another task, and we totally _forget about the previous task_, or we keep thinking
about this task and _cannot focus on any other task_ that we have to do.
Either way, the outcome does not go in favor for us. These unfinished tasks that
lure inside our mind are called _open loops_.

The second problem that causes bad time management: **open loops**.

Unfinished tasks stay better and longer in our short term memory (than finished tasks),
until we finish them. This is known as the **Zeigarnik effect**, named after
the Russian Psychologist -- _Bluma Zeigarnik_. However, we can fool the brain into thinking the task is done
by simply writing it down.

In order to better prioritize your tasks, you first need a _safe place_ to store all your
tasks. And NO, your brain is NOT that place. Transferring the tasks into an external system
(i.e., simply writing it down in a to-do list)
allows us to forget the tasks inside our head, but still preserve the idea.
If not, we have to remember everything in our head, and our brain is not good at
remembering a lot of stuff, we tend to forget things eventually.

Solution to bad prioritization of tasks and open loops: **use a to-do list**.

### How Time Blocking works?

We have now solved the problem of open loops by using a to-do list.
This will drastically reduce the anxiety and pressure inside your head, as now
you don't have to remember all your tasks. You can simply look at your to-do
list and see what tasks you have to complete, and by when. Now comes the
question, _"How do I find time to complete my tasks?"_

This is where time blocking comes into play. Time blocking, simply put, is an effective yet simple
way to take control of your entire day. It lets you control how you spend your
entire day (down to the very minute, if you want to). You basically divide your
entire day into blocks of time (of varying durations). Each _time block_ you create
is dedicated for finishing a particular task. This creates a schedule for your day,
which makes it easier to complete the task, than just by looking at a list of all
tasks in your to-do list.

The key to making this method work for you is _prioritizing your tasks_. Tasks with
higher priority get a time block that has a longer duration, and is placed usually
in the beginning of the day (when you're still fresh and motivated).
To get the most out of time blocking, create time blocks so that your entire day
is filled with it. This does not mean you have to work on your tasks the
entire day. Creating time blocks for the entire day involves blocks for your daily
routines, having food, and even your leisure time. If you watch a movie for 3 hours,
it does not mean that you wasted those 3 hours. However, if you do not have a clue as
to how your evening went, then that unplanned time is wasted time.

Time blocking actually enables you to complete more tasks within a given amount
of time. **Parkinson's Law** states that work expands so as to fill the time available for
its completion. This means that if you decide to complete a task in the evening,
you are more likely to take up the entire evening for it. However, if you dedicate
a time block (say from 6:00pm to 7:00pm), then you have a restriction on the time available
to complete the task, which will result in less distraction and more concentration
because you know you need to complete that task within the given hour.
This can also help you if you are a _perfectionist_ who takes way too much time to
give a perfect output, instead of giving a good enough output.

### Deep Work and Time Blocking

Time blocking might seem very simple. After all, it looks very similar to
a timetable given in schools. The catch here is that _you_ decide how your timetable
is going to be for the next day. _You_ create the blocks for tasks that you want
to do. _You_ set the duration for which you want to work on a particular task.
_You_ control how your entire day is going to be. This enables you to work on tasks
in a very effective way.

By the very nature of how it works, time blocking promotes **deep work**.
Simply put, deep work is when you work on a particular task for a fixed period
of time, without any distractions or breaks. You have your full concentration on the
task that is scheduled for the particular time block. No other tasks must interupt
this dedicated time. This allows you to concentrate on deep levels, and thus your output
will also be much better. It helps you quickly learn hard things and also produce at
an elite level.

> Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration
> that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.<br>
> -- Cal Newport

When people multitask, or even switch from one task to another, their attention does
not immediately follow. A residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the
previous task. This effect is known as **attention residue**. This residue gets
thick if you put low-effort and do not complete the previous task. By leveraging
time blocking and deep work, we can escape from the attention residue effect.

When starting with time blocking and deep work, there are 2 common problems that
you might face:

-   _You might not be able to finish a task within the dedicated time block_.
    This just means that your estimated duration for completion of the task was wrong.
    You can easily solve this problem by tracking how long you took to complete the task,
    and then later when a similar task pops up, you'll have a better estimate of the duration.
-   _There might be new obligations_ that pop up that require immediate attention.

If you face any of the above problems, simply reschedule the task later.
It does not matter how many times you reschedule a task. What matters is that you
stick to your schedule properly. You can also add _free time blocks_ that are scheduled,
but have no task attached to them (not even your leisure time). This block basically
means that you have no idea what to do during that time of your day.
When new obligations pop up, you can simply reschedule your current task to the _free
time block_.

### Practical Examples

By now you must know that for better time management, we need two things:

-   **To-do list**: A safe and trusted place where all your tasks go into.
-   **Calendar**: A daily scheduled calendar that enables you to divide your entire
    day into blocks of time.

<div class="thecap">

</div>
</div>

You are free to choose your own style of tools. Perhaps
the most simple way would be to use pen and paper. However, rescheduling your time blocks
and moving unfinished tasks to other days would not be so easy when using a pen and paper.
That is why I suggest using dedicated apps that work well for task management and
time blocking.

<div class="thecap">

</div>

I recommend using _Tick Tick_ for task management, and _Google Calendar_ for time blocking.
These apps are free to use, and are available in all platforms. Thus, you can use them on your
phone, laptop, and even on your smartwatches. The apps I use are _Things 3_ for task management, and _Apple Calendar_ for time blocking.
These apps are specific to Apple Ecosystem, and are not free to use.
However, I did start out with the free apps I recommended above. I suggest using the free apps,
and if you feel a restriction, only then switch to paid apps. Once you are ready with
your tools, you can start implementing what we learned.

#### Step 1: Add new tasks to your to-do list

This is the most important habit that you'll have to pick up. Any new task that
comes up goes straight into your to-do app. You can create multiple lists inside the
app. Tasks should be added to a list called the _inbox_. By the end of the day,
the inbox list should contain all the tasks (along with their deadline) that you have collected throughout the
day.

#### Step 2: Prioritize the tasks

Now that the day is over, and you have collected all tasks, create new lists for each _Area/Project_ the tasks might belong to.
For example, all tasks related to academics can go under a separate list. The goal
is to move all the tasks from the inbox list to a separate list, grouped
by some factor. Then, prioritize the tasks and give proper deadlines.

#### Step 3: Time block tomorrow

After prioritization of tasks, start implementing the time blocking technique
by scheduling the next day. Divide the entire day into blocks, and attach each task
to each block. Estimate the duration of each task and accordingly set the duration of
the time block. Make sure to include your daily routines as well to the calendar.
Time block the most important and big tasks first. Later, you can find gaps to fit in
blocks for small tasks. Add in the parts where you chill with friends, hang out with people,
and even your own personal time (maybe for listening to music, watching movie, etc.).

#### Step 4: Stick to your schedule

Ideally, you must now have a schedule (built by you) for the entire day, from when
you wake up, till when you hit the bed. Follow your schedule strictly. It is easier
said that done as you'll be constantly hit with new tasks, plans and other obligations.
In the midst of following your schedule, don't forget to follow Step 1.
This requires both dedication and discipline. Do note that I'm not suggesting you
to work the entire day, just to follow your schedule. Work on tasks when you have scheduled
them, and have fun when you have scheduled them.

If any new obligation come up that requires immediate attention, feel free to reschedule
your day accordingly. Sometimes, you might have to reschedule your entire day, which
is absolutely fine. In rare cases, you might not be able to follow your schedule
due to some external factor, which is also okay. If you fail to stick to your schedule for
one day, don't lose hope. Time block the next day and try again.

Time blocking is a simple yet very effective method that is used by highly productive
people such as Elon Musk and Bill Gates. It lets you control your entire day, and makes
sure that not a single minute of your time goes wasted. In order to leverage this technique
and make use of it, one must be motivated and have discipline over themselves. The best
part about this technique is that it works for everyone, irrespective of your domain of
work. I hope this blog was informative and inspired you to get into better time management.

Happy Working!
